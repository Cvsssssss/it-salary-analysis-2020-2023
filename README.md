# IT Salary Analysis (2020â€“2023) â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This project presents a visual and data-driven analysis of salary trends in the IT industry between 2020 and 2023, using real-world data sourced from Glassdoor and published on Kaggle. The dashboard was built in Power BI to help identify how salaries vary based on job title, experience level, company size, location, and time.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

After analyzing real-world IT salary data from 2020 to 2023, several clear conclusions emerged.

First, roles such as Data Analytics Lead, Data Science Manager, Data Science Tech Lead, and Cloud Data Architect consistently show the highest average salaries. In some cases, depending on experience and company size, the average compensation exceeded two million USD annually.

The data also reveals a strong correlation between experience level and salary. Executive and Senior positions earn significantly more than Mid-level or Entry-level roles. Additionally, larger companies tend to offer higher salaries across all experience levels, especially at the executive level.

When comparing employee locations, countries like the United States, Uzbekistan, Singapore, Slovenia, and Ukraine stand out with the highest average salaries. The trend over time also shows a notable increase in total salary payouts year by year. In 2020, the total salary recorded was below 0.1 billion USD, while in 2023, it surpassed 0.3 billion USD.

This growth reflects the rapid expansion of the global tech industry and the increasing demand for specialized roles in areas such as data science, machine learning, and engineering.
